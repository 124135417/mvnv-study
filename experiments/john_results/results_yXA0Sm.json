The links were greatly occluded by the nodes, so it was very difficult to tell them apart. I used search for nodes (it has a bug, when you write some one's name and then select it from the autocomplete with the keyboard, it doesn't fire the event). I searched for Jeef first, selected it, and then searched for Robert. Being able to drag nodes was very useful. I would have thought that clicking on the legeng values on the left would provide filters, so I tried doing that, but of course it didn't work"
